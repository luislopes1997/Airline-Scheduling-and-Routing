# Airline-Scheduling-and-Routing
This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence course from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

The airline industry is one of the most competitive ones in the world economy.
For instance, the pressure of the low-cost airliners pushed the whole industry
to pursue cost efficiency. One critical components of this efficiency is the
scheduling and routing of the airplanes, given a set of legs to be flown by the
company. This project addresses the problem of finding the daily schedule
and routing of airplanes that maximizes the company profit, hereby called
the Airline Scheduling And Routing (ASAR) problem

# How to test
In order to test the algorithm open the terminal window and run  `python3 solution.py Examples/<simple*.txt>`, where `<simple*.txt>` is the name of the configuration file.
